1. ARITHMETICAL OPERATORS IN C

There are two arithmetic operators in c 

1.Binary 
2.Unary

1.Binary arithmeticals operators are

-  is used for the substraction of the second value from the 1st one : eg: result=A-B=

+ Used for addition of two operators : eg : result=A+B=

/ Used for division of numbers : eg : result=A+B=

* Used for multiplication of numbers : eg : reslut=A*B=

% The modulus operator and the reminder after the division of an intiger : eg : result=B%A=


2.Unary arithmetical operators are

— used for Decrease of the integer value by the decrement operator by one : eg : reslut=A–

++ Used for increase of the integer value by the increment operator by one : eg : result=A++

–  Unary minus : eg :result= -A

+  Unary plus : eg :result=+A


2. RELATIONAL OPERATORS IN C

There are 6 types of relational operators 

1. Equal To
2. Not Equal To
3. Less Than
4. Greater Than
5. Less Than Or Equal To
6. Greater Than Or Equal To


3. LOGICAL OPERATORS IN C

We have three major logical operators in the C language:

1. Logical NOT (!) 
2. Logical OR (||)
3. Logical AND (&&)

1. This type of operator returns true whenever the conditions that are under condition are not at all satisfied.In any bounted case it is
   return false.For instance, the !p will return true if p is false, meaning, when p = 0.
   

2. This type of operator returns true even when both or even one of the conditions that are under consideration are satisfied.In any other
   case it will return false. For instance, the p || q will return true when both or one of p and q are true (non-zero). It also returns to be true when p and q are true.


3. This type of operator returns true when both the conditions that are under consideration happen to be satisfied.In any other case
   it is bound to return false. For instance, the p && q will return true when both- p and q are true (non-zero).


4. ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS IN C
   
 operators 	Operation Performed

 =	     Simple assignment
 *=	     Multiplication assignment
 /=	     Division assignment
 %=	     Remainder assignment
 +=	     Addition assignment
 -=	     Subtraction assignment
 <<=	     Left-shift assignment
 >>=	     Right-shift assignment
 &=	     Bitwise-AND assignment
 ^=	     Bitwise-exclusive-OR assignment
 |=	     Bitwise-inclusive-OR assignment

5. BIT WISE OPERATORS IN C

  Bit wise operators are characters which represent actions to be performed on single bits

   Operators	Meaning of operators
&	Bitwise AND
|	Bitwise OR
^	Bitwise XOR
~	Bitwise complement

6. CONDITIONAL OPERATORS IN C

   In the c programming language the operators are classified as unary,binary and ternary based on the number of operands they require
   in c programming the conditional operators is the only ternary operator and it is also refered to as the ternary operator


7.SHIFT OPERATOR IN C

  It is a binary operator that requires two operands to shift or move the position of the bits to the left side and add zeroes to the empty 
  space created at the right side after shifting the bits  

  The bitwise shift operators are the right-shift operator (>>), which moves the bits of an integer or enumeration type expression to the right
   and the left-shift operator (<<), which moves the bits to the left.
